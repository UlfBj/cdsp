# CDSP Best Practices/Design Guide
This is currently a rough notepad of Best Practices to capture important points as the project establishes itself. The intention is for this to result in Best Practice and Design Guide documents to guide the project.

1. Developers SHALL document both the *logical* and *implementation* concepts for extensions and examples. In particular the logical concept SHOULD at a minimum give a sense of the requirements for the problem being tackled in a way that allows alternative implementations to be considered. Contrast *problem/requirements XYZ can be met by logical concept ABC, illustrated in the implementation using technologies Foo* and *Product Foo has features XYZ*. The former contains useful information about a problem, how it might be logically addressed and an illustration implementing it. The latter possibly little if anything to say about the first two.
