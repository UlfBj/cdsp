## Central Data Service Playground Overview
The Central Data Service Playground (CDSP) serves as a neutral, open playground for data services both within and outside the vehicle in the context of data-centric architectures. It enables investigation into the internals of these services and how they can be combined. Furthermore, the playground provides a means to publish and collaborate on such work in the open.

The playground was first conceived by the COVESA Data Architecture team to meet their needs. They also recognized that there were the same needs in the wider community inside and outside COVESA. For example, to demonstrate how VSS data can be used with its eco-system for newcomers.

The chapters below digs deeper into the ideas behind the playgrond:

1. [Logical concept]({{< ref "cdsp-logical-concept.md" >}} "Explore the logical concept")
2. [Implementation concept]({{< ref "cdsp-implementation-concept.md" >}} "Explore the implementation concept")
3. [COVESA eco-system and beyond]({{< ref "covesa-and-beyond.md" >}} "How the playground fits into the wider eco-system")

## Playground lego pieces
Below is an unprioritized list of the lego pieces available at the playground.
The hope is that these pieces will not only be played with separately,
but that playground projects will be started to build larger structures by combining them.
* [VISSR]({{< ref "lego-pieces/vissr-viss" >}} "VISSR (VISS data server) Guide")
* [Apache IoTDB]({{< ref "lego-pieces/apache-iotdb" >}} "Apache IoTDB Guide")
* [Knowledge connector]({{< ref "lego-pieces/knowledge-connector" >}} "Knowledge connector Guide")
* [uServices mocker]({{< ref "lego-pieces/uservices-mocker" >}} "uServices mocker Guide")
